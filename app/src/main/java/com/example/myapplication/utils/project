dev queue:
report generation

dev enhancements:
UI (obviously)
clear entries or go back on submit
better error handling
code refactoring
remove wallet, category needed? How to implement?
cursor while displaying report, filtering (date range, log type), column selection
delete log -> rollback changes
edit log date

bugs/glitches:
double tap, triple tap, other gesture controls

notes:
look into react native to develop UI (after note: native is good but doesn't feel right for this one, another note: Have I come too far into Java and XML to go back now)
better understand activity lifecycle and android app development fundamentals, linux, etc.
understand how SQLITE works

completed:
add app icon
