dev queue:
report generation

dev enhancements:
UI (obviously)
clear entries or go back on submit
better error handling
code refactoring

bugs/glitches:
double tap, triple tap, other gesture controls

notes:
need better primary key for log table?
remove wallet, category needed? How to implement?
look into react native to develop UI (after note: native is good but doesn't feel right for this one)
better understand activity lifecycle and android app development fundamentals, linux, etc.
understand how SQLITE works
